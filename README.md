The basic implementation of Oblivious Data Structures (OMAT, OTREE, ODS) for 2018 IEEE TCC paper titled 'Efficient Oblivious Data Structures for Database Services on the Cloud'. The full paper is available on https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1238.pdf.

Our Oblivious Data Structures OMAT and OTREE are integrated into [CURIOUS](http://seclab.soic.indiana.edu/curious/), a framework for oblivious cloud storage

**Note:** The code is not fully structured and organized.
